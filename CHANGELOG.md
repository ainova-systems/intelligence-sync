## [0.1.0] — Initial release

First public release.

### Engine

- Single-source-of-truth design: author rules / agents / skills once under `intelligence/`; the sync engine routes content into each IDE's native format.
- Five built-in adapters: `agents` (AGENTS.md), `claude` (`.claude/`), `cursor` (`.cursor/`), `copilot` (`.github/`), `codex` (`.agents/skills/` + `.codex/agents/`).
- Pluggable adapter contract — drop a `<name>.sh` into `intelligence/scripts/adapters/` and it becomes available as a target.
- Zero runtime dependencies beyond `bash` and `awk`.

### Routing

- AGENTS.md is the canonical project doc — Cursor, Copilot, and Codex all read it natively. Always-on rules (no `paths:`) are inlined here once.
- Path-scoped rules stay in tool-specific channels (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc` with `globs:`, `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` with `applyTo:`) so monorepo glob targeting still works.
- Claude Code receives the full rule set in `.claude/rules/` because it does not read AGENTS.md natively.
- No duplication between AGENTS.md and IDE rule directories.

### Helpers

- `lint_frontmatter` warns on unquoted YAML colons and leading tabs in frontmatter — runs automatically before adapters fire (catches issues that strict consumers like Codex CLI reject silently).
- `get_model` resolves model names from `config.yaml` `models:` overrides, falling back to bundled defaults. Sync prints a drift report when an override no longer matches the current default.
- `update.sh` self-update — clones upstream into a `mktemp -d` directory, shows a diff, and replaces only `intelligence/scripts/` and `intelligence/INIT.md`. Project content (`config.yaml`, `rules/`, `agents/`, `skills/`) is never touched.

### Pre-installed skills

- `/intelligence-sync` — run sync
- `/intelligence-update` — pull latest engine
- `/intelligence-install-adapter` — enable an IDE target
- `/intelligence-uninstall-adapter` — disable and clean up an IDE target
- `/intelligence-add-rule` — create a rule with conventions
- `/intelligence-add-agent` — create an agent with conventions
- `/intelligence-add-skill` — create a skill with conventions

### Examples

- `examples/go-api/` — single-component Go service.
- `examples/dotnet-api-with-react-frontend/` — multi-component project, shared intelligence at root + per-component sources.
- `examples/platform-with-submodules/` — monorepo with git submodules excluded from parent sync.

### Documentation

- `README.md` — problem / why / how positioning.
- `intelligence/INIT.md` — bootstrap prompt for AI assistants (4 phases: discovery, recommendation, generation, verification).
- `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` — frontmatter formats, naming, sync transformations.
- `docs/ADAPTERS.md` — adapter contract, library function reference, distribution via `update.sh`.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, issue / PR templates.
