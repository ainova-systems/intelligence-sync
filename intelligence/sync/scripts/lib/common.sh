# --- Layout tokens -----------------------------------------------------------
#
# The umbrella folder is named by the project (`intelligence/`, `Intelligence/`,
# a codename) — so an artifact SHIPPED BY THE ENGINE cannot write that name
# down. A rule that scopes itself to the intelligence layer needs `paths:` to
# say "the umbrella", and an agent body needs to name the sync command. Both are
# spelled with tokens, expanded here at output time:
#
#   <umbrella>  ->  the repo-relative umbrella dir   (e.g. `Intelligence`)
#   <module>    ->  the repo-relative engine module  (e.g. `Intelligence/sync`)
#
# Values come from IS_UMBRELLA_REL / IS_MODULE_REL, which sync.sh derives from
# the detected layout (never hardcoded) and exports before any adapter runs.
# Expansion happens in EVERY generated file, frontmatter and body alike, so a
# scoped rule reaches Claude's `paths:`, Cursor's `globs:` and Copilot's
# `applyTo:` already carrying the project's real folder name.

# finalize_output_file <file>
# The single exit gate for every file an adapter writes: expand layout tokens,
# then normalize CRLF -> LF. Adapters MUST call this (not normalize_file_to_lf)
# on each output — a missed call ships a literal `<umbrella>` into an IDE.

# --- Source Resolution -------------------------------------------------------
#
# A `sources.*` entry is normally a LOCAL path resolved as `$repo_root/<entry>`.
# It may instead be a REMOTE git spec, which is materialized (shallow-cloned)
# and resolved to a local directory inside the clone. This is the SINGLE point
# where remote sources are detected and fetched — every adapter and sync.sh
# routes its `$repo_root/$src` through resolve_source_dir, so no other file
# needs to know about remote sources.
#
# Spec format (inline string, so read_yaml_list parses it unchanged):
#   git+<url>[@<ref>][#<subpath>]
#     <url>      explicit-scheme URL (https/http/ssh/git/file). Other transports
#                (notably the command-executing ext::/fd::) are rejected.
#     @<ref>     optional tag / branch / SHA — the segment after the last `@` in
#                the post-scheme part, accepted only if it has no `/` (so
#                userinfo like `ssh://git@host/...` is not mistaken for a ref;
#                branch names containing `/` are unsupported — use a tag, SHA,
#                or slashless branch, which is the recommended pin anyway).

# Copy a skill directory in full: SKILL.md plus any bundled resources
# (references/, scripts/, assets/ — the Agent Skills standard lets a skill
# ship support files beside SKILL.md, and SKILL.md bodies point at them by
# relative path, so dropping them breaks the skill at runtime). Markdown is
# normalized to LF; every other file is copied byte-for-byte so potentially
# binary assets survive. `cp -R` copies symlinks as symlinks (POSIX), so a
# link inside a source skill never leaks host file content into the output.
#
# SKILL.md frontmatter is quoted for EVERY consumer, not only the strict-YAML
# ones. `argument-hint: [pr-number]` is a YAML *flow sequence*, so an unquoted
# hint arrives as a list and Claude Code refuses the whole skill with
# "argument-hint must be a string" — the skill silently disappears from the
